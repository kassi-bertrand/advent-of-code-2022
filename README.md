# advent-of-code-2022

Advent of Code is a set of 25 programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.

The event happens once a year at the start of December. Programming puzzles get released on a daily schedule from December 1st to December 25th.

People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.

If you are student like me, I highly recommend you give it a try. It's event better when you do it with people you know :)
